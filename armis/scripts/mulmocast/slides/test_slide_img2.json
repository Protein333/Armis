Show several small mammals with distinctive forward-facing eyes and grasping hands clutching branches. Include anatomical details highlighting their specialized limbs for climbing and depth perception adaptations. The style should be realistic, educational, and suitable for a scientific presentation, with soft natural lighting filtering through the forest canopy. The scene should clearly demonstrate the arboreal lifestyle that shaped primate evolution."

Show this hominin walking upright with anatomically correct proportions—shorter than modern humans with longer arms, pronounced jaw, and smaller cranium. Include skeletal elements visible or partially overlaid to highlight the bipedal adaptations while maintaining scientific accuracy. The background should show African savanna that was expanding during this period, with scattered trees. The lighting should be natural daylight, and the style educational and suitable for a museum display."
